# Quantitative Pairs Trading Strategy

## Project Overview
This repository features a sophisticated pairs trading strategy developed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques. The strategy focuses on optimizing pair selection through advanced algorithms and backtesting methods to ensure robust performance and consistency.

### Key Features
- **Cointegration Testing**: Identifies pairs with a statistically significant cointegration relationship to target for trading.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Utilizes K-Means and Affinity Propagation Clustering to efficiently select stock pairs with similar price movements.
- **Backtesting Methods**: Employs OLS Regression, Random Forest, and Kalman Filter combined with Bollinger Bands to assess the strategy's effectiveness and robustness.

### Strategy Validation
The strategy has undergone rigorous backtesting on historical data to validate its performance metrics and risk management capabilities.
